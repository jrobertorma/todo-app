NOTES
PRIMARY GOALS
Build a todo-app from scratch, using react, redux and firebase.

What do you need to create the app?
	1. Initialize project (done)

	2. Design user cases, user stories, or something to establish the data flows and needed operations
	3. App design (UI and functionalities)

	4. Build backend (it is going to be mostly firebase configuration)
	5. Build front-end (components)
	6. Wire back and front ends
	7. Test
	8. First MVP release

	9. Document

2. APP DESIGN
	2.1 User cases
		There is going to be just one user (its name will be 'user', lol).
		'User' will have 3 basic user cases

		a) See to-do list: You call the firebase data and pass it to redux, you'll need to create a reducer, some actions and wire them to a data rendering component.
		b) Create a to-do list item: You will need a form, validate it (i guess we will use react-final-form) and use it to update the firebase data, I dont' know if redux is needed right here.
		c) Edit a to-do list item
			First you'll need the item data (fetching data from firebase)
			Then you'll need to show the data
			And lastly (trough a form) you will make the updates to firebase
			The delete item is going to be a similar operation

	2.2 UI and functionalities design
